For a walkthrough of the analyses presented in our paper, look in the notebook `data_analysis_pipeline.ipynb`. 

Much of the code in this repo is repurposed from [EduNLP/textbook-analysis](https://github.com/EduNLP/textbook-analysis), which was the basis for a precursor paper: [Content Analysis of Textbooks via Natural Language Processing: Findings on Gender, Race, and Ethnicity in Texas U.S. History Textbooks](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2332858420940312) by Li Lucy, Dorottya Demszky, Patricia Bromley, and Dan Jurafsky. 

Note that we do not release the data used for our project as textbooks are copyrighted. Thus, the code in this repository is not runnable as-is, and should instead be used as a guide for others wishing to learn how to run similar analyses on their data.
